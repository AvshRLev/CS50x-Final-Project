# CS50x-Final-Project
### Hi and welcome :smiley:
This is my final project for the [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) introduction to computer science course.
It is called **Avshi's wacky website** and it is supposed to be a fun break from everyday life. :circus_tent:

On this website there are 4 functionalities in 4 different sections and each of these sections brings data from a different API.

The first section checks whether at a given date in the past present or future the planet Mercury was in retrograde with further explanations about the phenomena and why it is important.
It take its data from [The Mercury retrograde API](https://mercuryretrogradeapi.com/about.html)

In the second section you can get NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) for a date of your choice, the picture comes with an explanation in text and both come from [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov/)

The Joke section of the website simply gets you a random joke from [the joke API](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) when you press the "Get Joke" button. :joy:

The last section is the history section which presents in three different tables the specific user's queries in each of the sections and the responses they got.
The data is stored in and retrieved from an sqlite3 database.db file.

The project is based in part on the distribution code given in the CS50x web track "finance" assignment. It is writen in Python's Flask framework, the templates are writen in HTML
and styled in CSS also using some [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) elements.

I hope you will enjoy it and if you are a potential employer i hope this convinces you to hire me. :wink: 

Thank you for reading and reviewing, Avshalom. :sparkling_heart:
